# E-Learning Platform Evaluation & Redesign (Design Thinking)

This repository documents the process of evaluating and redesigning an e-learning platform using the Design Thinking methodology. The project focuses on understanding user needs, identifying pain points, and developing innovative solutions to improve the platform's usability and overall user experience.

## Project Structure:
- **Research Deck**: Findings from user research, including problem identification, user personas, and ideation.
- **Wireframes & Designs**: Low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes, as well as design mockups for the platform's user interface.
- **Prototype**: Interactive prototype created in Figma, showcasing the redesigned platform.
- **User Testing Report**: Insights and recommendations derived from usability testing sessions.

## Key Deliverables:
1. Research Deck (User personas, problem statements, and solutions)
2. Wireframe and Low-Fidelity Designs
3. High-Fidelity Design & Prototype in Figma
4. User Testing Report (findings and recommendations for improvement)

## Tools & Technologies:
- **Design Thinking**: Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test
- **Figma**: For creating high-fidelity designs and interactive prototypes
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration
